# SuiteStore
Sell point created using HTML, CSS and Javascript, storing data on localStorage

## **Functionalities:**
- add and delete category
- add and delete product, with a select input populated by the categories created
- add and delete items from the cart
- view finished orders details

### _The website makes also the pre-reservation of the stock, if the purchase is finished by the user, the value is subtracted, and if the user chooses to cancel the purchase, then the items are added again to the stock._

## **Improvement points**
- _validations_: the validations are a bit weak and superficial, making a bettet treatment of error will improve the website
- _system status_: from the UX perspective, the user never knows on what page they are, so add functionalities or titles to improve that aspect
- _feedbacks_: there are not many feedbacks of actions made on the website (e.g "item added successfully!", "item deleted successfully!"...). Improving that aspect also helps the user to understant their actions on the website.
- _responsivity_: the website is not responsive to mobile interfaces.
